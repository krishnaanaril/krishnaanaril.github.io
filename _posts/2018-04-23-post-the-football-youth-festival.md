Football, the beautiful game as it is fondly called is bringing its youth-festival to our country. What else we need? It is a big lottery for a footballing minnow like India. Recently we launched a power-packed league (Inidan Super League) parallel to the national league ( I-League), with the back of lot of celebrities and fifa. It increased the popularity of football in this cricket friendly nation and Indian football team took giant strides in the rankings. Now they are sitting pretty at 97 (at the time of writing).

## Brazil vs Honduras 

The opportunity to watch this match came unexpected. That day I was busy in office with my usual chores, when my friend Arjun came with two complimentary passes he got from his relative. He was looking for a company and I jumped in. We went to Arjun’s home and walked to the Kaloor stadium which was just 1 km from there. We reached there a bit late and heard the kickoff whistle while we were ascending the stairs. Ours was the top tier, and it was a beautiful view when we plunged in to the crowd that is cladded in yellow. For those who are not much into Indian football scene, Brazil have a large fan base in Kerala, plus yellow is the home colors of the local team [‘Kerala Blasters’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Blasters_FC).

Once the excitement died, we searched for our seats and settled in. The game was mostly played by Brazil and Honduras was sitting back. It was beautiful to watch the game play of Brazil. They start their attack from the back and slowly builds forward with bunch of combinational passes in the final third which results in an opportunity. Brazil attacked in waves and there were occasional counter attacks from Honduras which reached no where. No.6 of Honduras was trying really hard to make some magic, but he didn’t get much support from his co-players.

Substitutions were in the later part of the game and it didn’t have much impact. The night ended with a comfortable victory for Brazil. We left the stadium during the final minutes to avoid the crowd and their rush. Fortunately I got a direct bus to my home and reached within half an hour.


## Spain vs Iran

This time we were five (football teammates) and we’ve booked our tickets in the lower tier. We were much closer to the ground, but the view was not that good as we expected. As it was another knock out game both teams fielded their full strength squad. Iran defeated the mighty France in the group games, so we were expecting a tight match, but it was another one sided match.

Spain were using their tried and tested tikki takka approach and Iran were not at all in the game. At the end they got a consolation goal but that was not enough. The Barcelona youth product [Abel Ruiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Ruiz) were so impressive and bullying Iran defenders. Once the match is over we were looking for a place to dine and have some chitchat. Noble suggested the [‘Sardarji ka dhabba’](https://www.facebook.com/sardarjikadhabakochi/) in Kaloor and we went there. The food was so yummy and the Sardarji was a very cool guy. The dishes were bit expensive but the food was really good and the ambiance was apt. 

## Extra-time

With the Spain-Iran match, all Kochi matches were finished and we watched the rest of the matches in tele. England went on to win the trophy by beating Spain in the finals. I was bit disappointed with the performance of Brazil as i am a big fan of their flair and playing style.  Liverpool’s Rhian Brewstar was the star of the tournament, and I am so happy that he did. Anyway it was good festive season for us and looking forward to the Russian world cup.
