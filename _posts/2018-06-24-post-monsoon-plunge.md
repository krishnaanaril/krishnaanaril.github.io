## Day zero: World Cup night 

It was past 5pm, me and Ajith were struggling with our office photocopy machine to take a copy of our ID card in the same page. We tried all the options in the settings but somehow couldn't make it. We were not in a mood to being adamant and waste our time there, so we left office with what we got. We were heading to Arjun's home to watch the world cup matches there. 

All our team members were there when we reached. There were three matches and the most anticipated one was the Spain – Portugal match which was scheduled at 11:30 pm. I watched first half of the match and retired to bed. Within half an hour in to the sleep I heard big shouting and clapping. 

“Cristiano scored a beautiful goal”, screamed Arjun and came to my room to wake me up. Though I was happy inside, I didn’t move an inch to not to spoil my sleep. With my half opened eyes I saw his rotund silhouette leaving the room, disappointed with my cold response.

## Day one: New faces and Mud games

My alarm rang at 6 am sharp. “Da, Wake up”, Ajith came to my room as I was struggling with my sleepiness to turn off the alarm.  Ajith had to return to his home to get his car, as we were planned to reach Thattekkad separately to accommodate  more people in the car. Me and Captain packed our stuffs in a rush and  started at around 7 pm. 

As communicated prior, we had to pick Swetha from Vytilla and Sheeba chechi from Thrippunithura. They were already waiting for us in the respective places and we got them in no time.  As we were strangers, there was a moment of silence in the car after exchanging our initial pleasantries. Soon the ladies started chatting about their family, trips and everything under the sky. Me and Arjun joined them occasionally, as we couldn’t find a gap amidst their shuttling of words. 

We reached Thattekkad by 9 pm and it was a bit early. We found few people waiting near the bus stop and guessed from their attire that they also came for the camp. There we met Prince and Ardra who was along with her father. We were bit hungry as we’ve skipped the breakfast, so me and Arjun went to the near by shop to have some tea and snacks. 

“Tea shops are the local news hubs”, it is a fact that various Sathyan Anthikkad movies has taught us. To get some info about the locality, I thought of chatting with its owner who may be in his early 40’s. I picked the most clichéd conversation starter. 

“Engane und chetta, Mazhayokke (Bro, How is the raining?)”. His reply was not the one we wanted to hear. “It was raining heavily till yesterday. Seems like the sky is clear today”, he replied in a mild tone which instantly killed our hype. When we came out of the shop we saw two ladies walking towards us(or to the tea shop?). Their big backpack was shouting loudly that they also came for the camp.  Ahal and Taslima, they introduced themselves and we did the same. Taslima passed a comment that my name is too long and difficult to pronounce. “You can call him KM”, Arjun was too swift to address her grievances. No surprise.  

Soon Ajith came with a couple of people he picked from various places. They were Akhil, Dhanuja, Shency teacher and Viji teacher respectively. Akhil was a kinda chatterbox and mingled with everyone in no time, Dhanuja was bit reserved at first or I felt so. Shency teacher, the lady in bright colored attire was full of energy and excitement and started taking selfies and photographs. So was Viji teacher who wore a specs to bring pseudo maturity. 

## Day two: Waterfall, leeches and some trekking
