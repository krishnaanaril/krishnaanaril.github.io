## Day zero: World Cup night 

It was past 5pm, me and Ajith were struggling with our office photocopy machine to take a copy of our ID card in the same page. We tried all the options in the settings but somehow couldn't make it. We were not in a mood to being adamant and waste our time there, so we left office with what we got. We were heading to Arjun's home to watch the world cup matches there. 

All our team members were there when we reached. There were three matches and the most anticipated one was the Spain – Portugal match which was scheduled at 11:30 pm. I watched first half of the match and retired to bed. Within half an hour in to the sleep I heard big shouting and clapping. 

“Cristiano scored a beautiful goal”, screamed Arjun and came to my room to wake me up. Though I was happy inside, I didn’t move an inch to not to spoil my sleep. With my half opened eyes I saw his rotund silhouette leaving the room, disappointed with my cold response.

## Day one: New faces and Mud games

My alarm rang at 6 am sharp. “Da, Wake up”, Ajith came to my room as I was struggling with my sleepiness to turn off the alarm.  Ajith had to return to his home to get his car, as we were planned to reach Thattekkad separately to accommodate  more people in the car. Me and Captain packed our stuffs in a rush and  started at around 7 pm. 

As communicated prior, we had to pick Swetha from Vytilla and Sheeba chechi from Thrippunithura. They were already waiting for us in the respective places and we got them in no time.  As we were strangers, there was a moment of silence in the car after exchanging our initial pleasantries. Soon the ladies started chatting about their family, trips and everything under the sky. Me and Arjun joined them occasionally, as we couldn’t find a gap amidst their shuttling of words. 

We reached Thattekkad by 9 pm and it was a bit early. We found few people waiting near the bus stop and guessed from their attire that they also came for the camp. There we met Prince and Ardra who was along with her father. We were bit hungry as we’ve skipped the breakfast, so me and Arjun went to the near by shop to have some tea and snacks. 

“Tea shops are the local news hubs”, it is a fact that various Sathyan Anthikkad movies has taught us. To get some info about the locality, I thought of chatting with its owner who may be in his early 40’s. I picked the most clichéd conversation starter. 

“Engane und chetta, Mazhayokke (Bro, How is the raining?)”. His reply was not the one we wanted to hear. “It was raining heavily till yesterday. Seems like the sky is clear today”, he replied in a mild tone which instantly killed our hype. When we came out of the shop we saw two ladies walking towards us(or to the tea shop?). Their big backpack was shouting loudly that they also came for the camp.  Ahal and Taslima, they introduced themselves and we did the same. Taslima passed a comment that my name is too long and difficult to pronounce. “You can call him KM”, Arjun was too swift to address her grievances. No surprise.  

Soon Ajith came with a couple of people he picked from various places. They were Akhil, Dhanuja, Shency ma'am and Viji ma'am respectively. Akhil was a kinda chatterbox and mingled with everyone in no time, Dhanuja was bit reserved at first or I felt so. Shency teacher, the lady in bright colored attire was full of energy and excitement and started taking selfies and photographs. So was Viji teacher who wore a specs to bring pseudo maturity. 

By 9:30 all the trekkers reached the assembling point and we’ve a quick introduction between ourselves. Our stay was arranged about 2 km from the thattekkad bus stop by our guide Sudeeshettan. He took us to that place which was amidst a rubber plantation. The rubber plantation was so near to the forest and we could see the electric fencing to keep the elephants away. We got few minutes to relax while others were freshening up from the long journey and we explored the place a bit.

Post that the coordinators Geethu and Sankeerth organized few games as an ice-breaking session and to get to know each other. It was very funny and we all really enjoyed it. Then Sudheeshettan came and gave a brief introduction about him and how he became a guide who helps bird watchers without any formal education. He was accompanied by the jovial Siby chettan who introduced himself as a script writer.

“Can we make a check dam in the near by stream?” Siby chettan asked to as we were thinking about further activities for the morning session. I’ve no idea what a “Check dam” was, but I was the first one to join. Half of the team were reluctant at first, but that didn’t kill the enthusiasm of the rest of the others. We soon started collecting stones and sticks for the dam. It took some time, but somehow we managed to contain the streams flow with our mighty dam. Once the dam building was over and we started playing in the water and took some group photos there.

Our lunch was arranged in the nearby house and it was a tasty kerala style meals. Afternoon we went to a marshy land to have our mud games. We played like children there till evening. Unfortunately one girl had an ankle sprain and we took her to the hospital, barring that it was a fun-day. In the night we bathed in the nearby stream and played anthakshari during camp fire. A little shower abruptly ended our camp fire and everyone went to their respective tents. I shared the tent with captain. The decathlon tent was too small for two of us but I had a decent sleep.

## Day two: Waterfall, leeches and some trekking

Morning I woke up around 6 am and had a black coffee which they provided. There were few early risers as well. We chatted for some time before getting ready for our main event for the day, ‘Uralan thanni’ waterfalls. We need to take a bus journey and about 30 minutes walk to reach there. On the walk Sudheeshettan showed us some birds and explained about them. I wasn’t much interested in it as my mind was in the waterfalls.

That place looked like an unexplored place as it requires forest departments permission and a long walk. We were the only people there on that day. There were a lot of leeches there and one or two bite me as well. As we were aware of it, everyone took salt and with the help of that we removed the leeches from our legs. Later we had bather, took photos and explored a cave nearby. The cave exploraton was the most exciting one as it was bit risky and dangerous. Fortunatly nothing bad happened. Post lunch we went to explore the salim ali bird trail. It was long walk without much birds in the visiblilty. On the way Sudheeshattan exhorted to us about the need to protect environment and the cause of wild fire etc. He also showed a mixed habitat of birds in the forest. Mixed habitat is a place in the forest were birds of wide variety stays and have a living. This trekking was kind of tiring and boring for most of us.

As the day was closing Geethu asked us to give a review about the camp. Everyone give postive reviews and was very happy. On the way back we had some spicy food and bit toddy from  the nearby toddy parlour. The food was very tasty and the toddy was good as well. Once we reached the camp we packed our belongings and bid farewell.

I reached home by 8:30pm and went to sleep in no time as I was bit tired. This trip and camp was one of a kind in my life and will always cherish it.
